The following steps must be followed in order to execute the recognition:
- In the code.ipynb file the file path must be specified in section [164], and it must be executed. Then export the image from section [170] as output in the same folder. In this way the preprocessing is obtained. 
- Execute predict.py to perform the classification.
- The classification is obtained as a file with the same name as the parent + _procesado.png.
